    @title = LE1F-B "Boar" Liquid Rocket Engine
    @description = A modernized LE1F "Regor" engine with simpler construction and designed with modern manufacturing methods. The most notable visual differences include an optmized nozzle shape and the huge turbo exhaust now dumped over the side instead of injected into the bell. Increased thrust over the LE1F-A at the cost of lower efficiency. Two of these engines are used in the Twin Boar integrated liquid fuel booster.

The most notable visual differences include an optmized nozzle shape and the huge turbo exhaust now dumped over the side instead of injected into the bell. Increased thrust over the F1-A at the cost of slighter lower efficiency. Two of these engines are used in the Pyrios integrated liquid fuel booster.

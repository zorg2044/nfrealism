    @description = For some reason, instead of developing cryogenic engines for upper stages, the designers of Poodle decided they wanted staged combustion LF/Ox. So they went and made it.

    real_manufacturer = Chemical Automatics Design Bureau
    real_description = A staged combustion cycle upper stage engine pushing the limits of kerolox performance. Designed for use on Soyuz 2.1 and Angara.
